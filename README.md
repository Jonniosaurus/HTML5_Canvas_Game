~~~ Test HTML 5 Game by Jonathan Edwards ~~~

This pre-alpha demo is currently compatible with modern versions of Firefox and Chrome.
It was written entirely in Javascript using the standard HTML5 API (no additional libraries). 
Guide the blue rectangle around by left clicking on the grid. Take care to avoid the pink baddies and the missiles, 3 hits and it's game over!

Notes: 
 - Ensure the zoom is set to 100% for best results.
 - Internet Explorer is not currently supported.
